## Assignment 1 (100 points):
Look at the code we covered today. Change the languages from german<>english to french<>german (if you are not comfortable in using raw data in github for french, then change g<>e to english<> german translation)
Change the model such that it has 3 layers instead of 2
Train the model on Colab, upload to Github and share the link
## Assignment 2 (900 points):
Look at this sample file: sample.py Preview the documentYou are to write such examples, where you describe the code to be written (starts with #), and the code it should generate. The file shows 3 examples of what text should generate what code. 
write 100 such examples. These are the requirements:
if you want the code to print something, then mention "print" in the text
read the sample.py clearly to see the examples and learn from it. If you want the code to write a program, you are NOT asking to write a function. If you want a function, please mention it. 
run the code in the terminal/notebook and make sure it runs!
you cannot write more than 5 simple functions like add 2/3/4/5 numbers or divide, etc. Try and think of something tough, for example, add a list or tuple together. 
stick to python only (no 3rd party library like numpy, etc)
here are some examples:
provide the length of list, dict, tuple, etc
write a function to sort a list
write a function to test the time it takes to run a function
write a program to remove stop words from a sentence provided,
etc
This assignment is of 900 marks. Each example if 9 marks. If your example is similar to someone else, then you score less. The formula we will use is 9/(repeated example). That means if 9 people write same example, then you get only 1. So think different! (if examples are mentioned here and in the sample file, you will score less)
Once done, please upload the file to github and share another link on the LMS.
